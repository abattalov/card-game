# Card Game Learning Project

A progressive learning journey through card game development, building from simple concepts to complex gameplay mechanics.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project follows a structured roadmap to learn game development fundamentals by implementing increasingly complex card games:

1. **War** - Basic game logic and turn management
2. **Go Fish** - Hand management and player interaction  
3. **Crazy Eights** - Rule engines and special card effects
4. **Canadian Salad** - Complex trick-taking with bidding

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript** - Component-based UI with type safety
- **CSS** - Custom styling and animations
- **No external game libraries** - Building everything from scratch for learning

- Win conditions
- Basic state management

### Phase 2: Go Fish
**Learning Focus:** Player interaction
- Hand management
- Player-to-player card requests
- Set collection mechanics

### Phase 3: Crazy Eights  
**Learning Focus:** Rule systems
- Card matching validation
- Special card effects
- Game state modifications

### Phase 4: Canadian Salad
**Learning Focus:** Complex gameplay

- Advanced scoring

## 🚀 Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## 📚 Learning Notes

This project prioritizes learning over using existing solutions. Each game builds upon concepts from previous implementations, creating a solid foundation for game development skills.

**Key Learning Areas:**
- State management in React
- Event handling and user interaction
- Game logic and rule implementation
- UI/UX for interactive applications
- TypeScript for type-safe development
